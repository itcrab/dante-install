# dante-install
Dante server install on Ubuntu 24.04

## Usage

Just two shell commands:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itcrab/dante-install/master/dante-install.sh
sh dante-install.sh
```

### Why we don't doing chmod +x dante-install.sh?

You can do this but we using this script from command line and don't needed rights to execute.
